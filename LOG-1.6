Development of TALYS since release of TALYS-1.4

- December 28, 2011

********** Release of TALYS-1.4 **********

- December 30, 2011

Introduced non-equidistant binning for the excitation energy grid.
The excitation energies can now be given on a logarithmic grid,
and this has also become the default. It allows to use less excitation 
energy bins while not losing precision. The old situation, of TALYS-1.4
and before, can be invoked with the new 'equidistant' keyword, but
from now on the default will be 'equidistant n'.
Especially for cross sections above 100 MeV the improvement is 
significant: smoothness and more reliable absolute values.
TALYS can now technically be used up to 600 MeV, though I did
not validate that with experimental data yet.

- January 2, 2012

Added the extra MT numbers 152-200, introduced in the ENDF-6 format 
in 2010, in the normalization subroutine.

- January 9, 2012

Multiplied the normalization factor for stripping reactions for 
helions with a factor of 5 to better fit (n,h) data.

- January 16, 2012

Added the statement "Positive parity" to the level density output
file in case of parity-dependent level densities, on the advice
of Goran Arbanas.

- January 17, 2012

Solved a problem reported by Patric Granholm.
At energies far below the Coulomb Barrier, some excitation functions
showed discontinuities. This was due to a too strict choice of 
pre-equilibrium spin distributions in subroutine binary.f.
A popepsA constant is now added.

- January 17, 2012

Turned a few TALYS-errors into warnings (TALYS no longer stops) in
integral.f. Also changed the naming of the associated data into 
talys/structure/integral in which experimental data and fluxes
can be found.

- January 21, 2012

Patric Granholm's problem of jan 17 motivated me to extend the
'preeqspin' keyword. There are now 3 possibilities:
preeqspin 1 (equivalent to the old 'preeqspin n'): the pre-eq spin 
  distribution is made equal to the relative spin-dependent population 
  after compound nucleus emission
preeqspin 2: the spin distribution from total level densities is adopted
preeqspin 3 (equivalent to the old 'preeqspin y'): the pre-eq spin 
  distribution is based on particle-hole state densities
The input is backward compatible, i.e.
preeqspin y is transformed into preeqspin 3
preeqspin n is transformed into preeqspin 1
Total number of possibilities: preeqspin can be equal to y,n,1,2,3

- February 1, 2012

Added more adjustment flexibility. With the tljadjust keyword the 
transmission coefficients for the outgoing channel can be changed in a 
certain energy range. 

- February 3, 2012

Added more adjustment flexibility. With the 'branch' keyword the 
branching ratio for any discrete level in the database can easily be 
overwritten in the user input. This may be necessary to adjust isomeric 
cross sections.

- February 13, 2012

Corrected a bug found by Yuki Watanabe: for charged-particle elastic 
and inelastic scattering the compound components are not written to 
output. Corrected angdis.f for this.

- February 13, 2012

Fixed a problem with the calculation of D0 for the case of incident 
photons, (used for level density studies) found by Stephane Goriely. 
I changed dtheory.f for this.

- February 14, 2012

Removed a bug in rldm.f, introduced just before the release of 
TALYS-1.4: A min() function was introduced to prevent an array running 
out of bounds.  However, this gives huge fission cross sections for 
neutrons on subactinides (or any other case where the RLDM is needed), 
as discovered by Stephane Goriely.

- February 16, 2012

On the advice of Stephane Goriely, I made a change in fissionpar.f: if
no fission barriers are found in the tables with phenomenological 
values, first the tables of Mamdouh (fismodel 2) are scanned for 
values, before an analytical model is used.

- February 20, 2012

After a question by Yuki Watanabe, I decided to introduce the 
'cpang' keyword, to enable the calculation of discrete level 
compound nucleus angular distributions for incident charged particles

- February 25, 2012

Changed the order of reading lines from files of the best/ directory 
such that the "best" parameters are now also used for natural targets.

- March 6, 2012

Added radiative capture model for direct and semi-direct capture cross 
section. For this the 'racap' keyword was made. By default, 'racap n'.

- March 11, 2012

Added new microscopic level densities, this time generated from 
temperature-dependent HFB calculations and the Gogny D1M nucleon force. 
This option is now 'ldmodel 6'

- March 27, 2012

Automatically increased the number of included discrete levels for a
highly excited isomer.

- March 27, 2012

To increase fitting flexibility I added the keywords egradjust, 
ggradjust, sgradjust, epradjust, gpradjust, spradjust, E0adjust, 
Exmatchadjust, Tadjust, fisbaradjust and fishwadjust, all with a 
default value of 1.

- March 27, 2012

About 70 keywords can now have energy-dependent values. After the 
keyword and its value are given in the input, an energy range can 
be specified over which the corresponding model parameter is altered. 

- March 29, 2012

Incident energies can now be given in any order, not necessarily in 
ascending order. They will be sorted first. Also double energy points 
will be removed. TALYS will thus no longer stop when this is provided.

- April 11 2012

Solved an output bug found by Mahdi Baktiari. At energies far below 
the Coulomb barrier the direct elastic angular distribution for charged
particles is not copied into the total column.

- April 21 2012

Changed nexout into nexout2 in do loop around line 70 in specemission.f
That error has been there for several years.

- April 26 2012

Generalized a few energy grids, so that TALYS can be used up to 600 MeV.

- May 7 2012

Vivian Demetriou found a problem in the alpha folding potential 
which I corrected.

- August 12 2012

Added keyword 'production' for (medical) isotope production.
Added decay data subroutine.

- August 15 2012

Extended nucleon OMP to 1 GeV. For this the keywords Vinf, Ejoin,
w3adjust and w4adjust give some extra flexibility. TALYS can now
technically be used up to 1 GeV.

- August 28 2012

Added all other routines for medical isotope production. With
the 'production' keyword, excitation functions are automatically 
transferred into isotope production rates in MBq. Various 
extra keywords are included for flexibility.

- September 11 2012

Corrected an error for particle multiplicities found by Pedro Arce.
The yields should be defined relative to the nonelastic cross section
and not to the reaction cross section. This makes a difference at
low energies and will change charged-particle nuclear data libraries, 
which use this information.

- September 15 2012

Added possibility to locally adjust the OMP parameters for outgoing
channels only, with the keyword 'incadjust'. If 'incadjust n' then OMP 
adjustments are not performed for the incident channel. This gives more
fitting flexibility. Physical argument is that the magnitude of the
approximation to regard inverse channels as occurring from the ground 
state, it unknown. (temperature dependent OMP). The default is however 
still 'incadjust y'.

- September 15 2012

Arnd Junghans discovered a reading error in the RIPL file for S0. 
Some of the values do not have a decimal point, resulting in a factor 
of 100 difference for some nuclides. Fortunately S0 is not used, 
apart from reference, but the error is now corrected anyway. At his 
advice, I also removed the printing of the neutron strength function 
at the wrong place (it was in the middle of the gamma data).

- October 6 2012

Introduced a keyword Liso to enforce the isomeric number of the target
(by default it is determined from the discrete level database).

- October 15 2012

Added a keyword fisfeed to output the fission per excitation energy bin.
This allows to couple TALYS with a fission yields code, like GEF.
To enable this, a few outlets in multiple.f had to be made.

- December 10 2012

Changed a statement in the output about level densities. The 'total' 
column is given per parity. (issue discovered by Paul Koehler).

- December 21 2012

Revised the direct radiative capture model together with Stephane 
Goriely. Three new keywords were introduced: 
ldmodelracap, sfexp and sfth.

- December 21 2012

The resulting intermediate code version is called TALYS-1.50

- March 19 2013

Complemented RIPL discrete level database with levels calculated from 
microscopic densities. A new keyword 'disctable' was introduced to 
include or exclude such additions. The default is now 'disctable 1', 
i.e. RIPL discrete levels file + levels added up to level number 100 
if missing from RIPL.

- April 27 2013

Changed 'ecis06' into 'ecis' for filenames etc., to make 
the filenames independent of the version of ECIS.

- May 18 2013

Increased boundaries for keyword massexcess from 0.500 to 0.600 a.m.u.

- May 20 2013

Put an if statement around loop 150 in comptarget.f to solve an NaN
problem found by Satoshi Chiba for astrophysical calculations.

- May 21 2013

Enforced that the non-elastic cross section is non-negative by
putting a max around xsnonel in binary.f

- May 21 2013

Changed an .lt. into an .le. in tripathi.f which solves a strange ifort
compilation problem.

- May 27 2013

Problem found by Mahdi Bakhtiari for elastic scattering angular
distributions for natural targets. For charged particles these
were not summed to the natural value. Corrected natural.f

- June 4 2013

Wrote more parameters to parameters.dat file

- June 24 2013

Corrected two problems found by Peter Mohr: if cpang y then the
charged-particle compound elastic angular distribution should
be anisotropic (though symmetric). Corrected angdis.f for this.
Also, for incident charged particles, direct discrete
contributions are not taken into account if a coupling scheme
is given. The default for the 'spherical' keyword is changed for this.

- June 30 2013

Added call for GEF subroutine, created by Vasily Simutkin and 
Michail Onegin, to massdis.f to use the Schmidt-Jurado model for 
fission observables. Introduced the fymodel keyword to choose FY 
model fymodel 1= Brosa, fymodel 2 = GEF.
fymodel 1 is now also the default.

- August 18 2013

As requested by Paul Koehler, added the average alpha and proton widths
in the output of the URR subroutines.

- August 22 2013

Disabled the renormalization of the URR by the NJOY method, as a 
default at least, to avoid unstable results for the competitive width.

- September 24 2013

Added radiounit and yieldunit keywords to specify units for medical
isotope production

- October 11 2013

Repaired an error in optical model adjustment, discovered by Vlad and 
Marilena Avrigeanu, the Coulomb radius was not adjusted with rcadjust.

- December 1 2013

Added new version of GEF subroutine, created by Vasily Simutkin and 
Michail Onegin, called geftalys.f. Fission yields, P(nu), nubar, and nu
as function of Z and A are added to the output. Introduced two extra 
keywords: outfy, to give detailed output of the GEF calculation,
and gefran, for the number of random events to be fed to GEF.
