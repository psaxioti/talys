Development of TALYS since release of TALYS-2.0

- December 29, 2023

********** Release of TALYS-2.0 **********

- February 8 2024

Solved a small bugs in the metadata for ENDF MF and MT numbers in channelsout.f90

- February 8 2024

Solved a small bugs in the metadata for continuum inelastic, the printed level was wrong

- February 10 2024

On advice of Caleb Mattoon, used underscore in multiple name headers in YANDF 
for easier parsing

- February 11 2024

Made output files for gamma's much more descriptive by adding YANDF metadata
in gammadecay.f90 

Solved a bug in angelout.f90 for the Legendre coefficient files.
Bug found by Caleb Mattoon. Some of the data sets were written twice

Added an 'E" to discrete level output for assignment of energy level.

- March 2 2024

Added the D0 from completely theoretical calculations including confidence interval 
to the output of level density files. These can be used when no experimental D0 is 
available to constrain level density fits.

- March 11 2024

Provided the complete decay of a nuclear reaction into more structureed YANDF output.
Now, if 'population y' one obtaines 'pop**.tot' files in which the compete decay 
of each nucleus is provided. This allows even more exclusive following of a nuclear reaction 
in terms of reaction probabilities.

- March 16 2024

Solved an output error, column headers were written out of phase for 'components y',
found by Zain Ul Abideen.
